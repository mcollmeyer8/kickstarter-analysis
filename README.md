# Kickstarting with Excel
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
To help Louise gather data on other Kickstarter campaigns, so she can better plan her own Kickstarter campaign

## Analysis and Challenges
Our analysis reviewed various types of Kickstarter campaigns, of varying topics, durations and monetary goal points, in different countries. Analyzing so much data, and rendering it down to a useful data set for Louise to reference was a challenge.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
None

## Results & Recommendations
Based on our findings, Louise should set a Kickstarter goal under $10,000. Our findings determined that $5,000 was the mean goal of the successful campaigns.
May had the most successful theater Kickstarter launches, with October seeing the most failures in this category. 
Additional analysis will be required to determine a final recommendation for Louise.
