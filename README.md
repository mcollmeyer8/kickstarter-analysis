# Kickstart Comparison for Louise

## Overview of Project
Compare Kickstart campaigns for plays by launch dates and funding goals

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
 Using the Kickstarter dataset, I created visual documentation for campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
** Add Theater_Outcome_vs_Launch.png

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
** Add Outcomes_vs_Goals.png

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges I encountered include:  1) It took me a while to figure out how to filter the row labels on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date by month, and 2) how to format the COUNTIFS statements to populate the Outcomes Based on Goals table.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the best month to launch a theater Kickstarter campaign.
October is the worst month to launch a theater Kickstarter campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The majority of the successful campaigns had a goal of under $20,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There were 0 cancelled campaigns in this dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A chart that compares successful campaigns (goal, duration of campaign) for plays for the past 5 years could potentially help us predict future campaign success.
A table and corresponding graph that documents backer_count for successful vs unsuccessful campaigns.
